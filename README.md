# Software Testing using Selenium

This project demonstrates software testing using Selenium with Python. Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling a web browser through the program and is commonly used for automated testing of web applications.

## What is Selenium?

Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming languages like Python, Java, C#, and more. Selenium supports major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, making it a versatile choice for web application testing.

### Key Features of Selenium:
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Test your web applications across different browsers.
- **Language Support**: Write your tests in multiple programming languages.
- **Framework Integration**: Integrates well with testing frameworks like pytest, unittest, and more.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Offers extensive documentation and a supportive community.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run Selenium tests using this project, you need to set up your environment with the following tools:

### Python
Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### pip
Ensure pip (Python's package installer) is installed. Pip usually comes with Python. You can check by running:
```bash
pip --version
python -m venv venv
pip install selenium
pip install webdriver-manager
pip install python-dotenv
python your_script.py
```
Make sure to replace `"your_script.py"` with the actual name of your Python script and customize any additional details relevant to your project.
